# svv
## A multi purpose app.
## Installing
I heavly recomend downloading [this](https://github.com/sevisadev/svv/blob/main/svv%20Installer%20and%20Updater.bat) and running it to download svv corectly. It auto downloads the latest version (overwriting the old one if needed) directly to the path it was ran,  then un-zips it and add a shortcuts, finally it deletes the zip and launches svv. I recommend using this as there are multiple files on the release so it may get confusing.
## Source Code
The base source code can be found [here](https://github.com/sevisadev/svv/tree/main/sc).
